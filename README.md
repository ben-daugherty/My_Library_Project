# My_Library_Project

This is a simple concept/app. Basically there's two pages: the first is the homepage, which consists of the logo and some basic
instructions to get the ball rolling. From there you can click on the Library link to enter into the main functionality of the website. 

On the 'Library' page there will be some seed data of titles already listed. These implement the basic functionality of the CRUD app:
You can Create new titles, Read existing or created ones, Update existing title's info, and Delete titles. 

From the 'Edit' page for instance, you can either get back to the Library page by editing a title and clicking save, or clicking 
'Back to List'. The other CRUD app pages work in a similar way. 

Please use the solution version '01' if it gives you an option.
